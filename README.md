- **Current Weather**: Get real-time weather information for a specific location, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more.
- **Forecast**: Retrieve weather forecasts for upcoming days, providing users with insights into weather conditions over time.
- **Location Search**: Search for weather information based on location names, such as cities or landmarks.
- **Unit Conversion**: Support for temperature units (e.g., Celsius, Fahrenheit) to cater to various user preferences.
- **Data Accuracy**: Access weather data from reliable and trusted sources to ensure accuracy and reliability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

The Weather API is built using the following technologies:

- **Node.js**: A JavaScript runtime used for server-side development.
- **Express**: A web application framework for Node.js that simplifies the development of server-side applications.
- **OpenWeather API**: An API that provides weather data from a variety of sources.
- **Axios**: A popular HTTP client library used for making HTTP requests to external APIs.
- **JSON**: A lightweight data-interchange format used for representing weather data in a structured format.
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking changes and collaborating on the project.
- **GitHub**: Hosting platform for storing and sharing the project repository.
